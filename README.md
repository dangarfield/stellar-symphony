This is all a big TODO

Notes:

Song structure - Use mag-diff All - Generally high crescendo - Could create the general volume / intensity of the soundscape
    - Maybe use abs-mag diff as structure
Chords - Use absmag-diff all - Negative diff = minor, Positive diff = major. Select a number of buckets from which to derive the chord intervals / scale
    - absmag - In 24 buckets - 3,4,5,6 (Min - 0.025, Max -0.05). 13,14,15,16 (Min - 0.075, Max - -0.075)
    - mag - In 24 buckets - 13,14,15,16 and 17,18,19,20 (Min - 0.05, Max - -0.05)
    - Each points to intervals
    - tonejs/scale to find intervals sl
Tempo - Maybe something to do with rv, average rv diff
Rhythmn / emphasis - ? Something to do with pulses, pulsars / high rv stars in system?
Key - ?
Time sig - ?
Melody notes - ? Something to so with main stars?

Something to do with the lines of stars - angles, distances from each other, emphasis of stars with multiple connected lines?

All the same key?

Melody line from 3 stars, using scales - It should / could look like it is being representative of the main stars (eg, can animate too)
    - Each star has a mag / absmag. The different ratio in brightness between them could represent the notes as distributed and across a 2 octave scale, maybe not alwasy 2 octaves. There should be a variable limit, maybe bases on the total number of main stars (<5 = 1 oct, >5 = 2 octaves, > 12 = 3 octaves)
    - Each star should use notes from the scale identified (?), maybe change these for different intervals
Melody comes in a different places
Chord structure underneath changes during different parts of the progression
